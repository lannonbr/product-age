# Product Age

A small app to check how old my tech products I own are.

## Setup

- Clone this repo.
- Create a JSON file at `mvc/models/products.json` with an array of products as such:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "iPhone 15",
    "purchaseDate": "January 1, 2024"
  }
]
```

- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run the app: `npm run dev` or `npm run prod`

This is a Roosevelt app. See the [docs](https://github.com/rooseveltframework/roosevelt#available-npm-scripts) for more information about configuring and running the app.
